
ans 

array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

why

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));`: This line logs information about `arr1` to the console. `arr1.length` is 5, which is the number of elements in the array. `arr1.slice(-1)` returns the last element of the array, which is "s". So, it will log: `array 1: length=5 last=s`.
