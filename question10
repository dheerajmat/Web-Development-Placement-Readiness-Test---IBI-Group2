console.log(1); is executed first, and it logs the number 1.

setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2); is added to the event queue but doesn't execute immediately since the delay is 0. It waits until all synchronous code is finished.

console.log(4); is executed next, and it logs the number 4.

Now, all synchronous code has finished. JavaScript starts processing the event queue.

The printNumber(2) function from the first setTimeout is executed, logging the number 2 to the console.

Finally, after 100 milliseconds, the printNumber(3) function from the second setTimeout is executed, logging the number 3 to the console.
